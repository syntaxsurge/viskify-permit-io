| **Database** | PostgreSQL via **drizzle-orm**; typed schema generation                                |
| **Auth**     | Signed HttpOnly cookie sessions; bcrypt hashes                                         |

🛠️ Engineering Notes

- Type Safety - End-to-end zod validation on every mutation, plus drizzle-orm type inference.
- UI Guidelines - All components use Tailwind, shadcn/ui, 2xl rounded corners, XL headings, soft shadows.
- Accessibility - Focus rings, semantic HTML tags, aria-hidden handled where necessary.
- Caching - revalidate directives keep the landing static while dynamic sections (pricing) are server rendered every hour.
- Security - VC issuance keys & Stripe secrets never leak to the client; server actions enforce role-based guards.
